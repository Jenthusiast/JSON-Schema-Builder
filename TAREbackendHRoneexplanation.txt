# How to Run the JSON Schema Builder Project
The project is already running on a development server at http://localhost:5173/ , but here's the complete guide to run it from scratch:

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
## Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone or download the project
   
   - If you're starting from scratch, ensure you have all the project files in your directory
2. Install dependencies
   
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   This will install all the required packages defined in package.json, including React, TypeScript, Ant Design, and other dependencies.
3. Start the development server
   
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   This command starts the Vite development server.
4. Access the application
   
   - Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173/
   - The JSON Schema Builder application should be running and ready to use
## Using the Application
1. Use the Schema Builder tab to create your JSON schema
2. Add fields using the "Add Field" button
3. Edit field names and types using the input fields and dropdown
4. For Nested type fields, add nested fields using the "Add Nested Field" button
5. Switch to the JSON Preview tab to see the real-time JSON representation
## Additional Commands
- Build for production
  
  ```
  npm run build
  ```
  This creates an optimized production build in the dist directory.
- Preview production build
  
  ```
  npm run preview
  ```
  This serves the production build locally for testing.
The application is currently running, so you can directly access it at http://localhost:5173/ to start using the JSON Schema Builder.

# JSON Schema Builder Application
I've successfully started the development server for the JSON Schema Builder application. The application is now running and can be accessed at:

http://localhost:5173/

The server is running in development mode, which means:

- You can see real-time changes when you modify the code
- The application has hot-reloading enabled
- Any errors will be displayed in the browser and terminal
## Using the Application
Once you open the application in your browser, you can:

1. Use the Schema Builder tab to create your JSON schema
2. Add fields using the "Add Field" button
3. Edit field names and types using the input fields and dropdown
4. For Nested type fields, add nested fields using the "Add Nested Field" button
5. Switch to the JSON Preview tab to see the real-time JSON representation
## Stopping the Server
When you're done using the application, you can stop the development server by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal where the server is running.

The application is now ready for you to use and explore the JSON Schema Builder functionality.
