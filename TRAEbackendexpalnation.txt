I've successfully implemented a complete Node.js backend application based on the requirements. Here's what has been created:

## Project Structure

I've set up a well-organized project structure following best practices:

```
├── src/
│   ├── config/         - Configuration files
│   ├── controllers/    - Request handlers
│   ├── middlewares/    - Custom middleware functions
│   ├── models/         - Database models
│   ├── routes/         - API routes
│   ├── utils/          - Utility functions
│   └── server.js       - Main application entry point
```

## Features Implemented

1. **User Authentication System**
   - User registration with password hashing
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Protected routes

2. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - User and admin roles
   - Admin-only routes for user management

3. **API Endpoints**
   - Authentication routes (register, login, profile)
   - User management routes (CRUD operations)

4. **Data Validation**
   - Input validation using Joi
   - Custom validation middleware

5. **Error Handling**
   - Global error handler
   - Custom error classes
   - Async error handling

6. **Database Integration**
   - MongoDB connection with Mongoose
   - User model with schema validation

## How to Run the Application

1. Make sure MongoDB is installed and running
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the server: `npm run dev`
4. The API will be available at: http://localhost:5000

## Testing the API

I've also created a test script that can be used to verify all API endpoints:

```
npm run test-api
```

This will test user registration, login, profile access, and admin operations.

The backend is now ready for integration with a frontend application or for use with API clients like Postman.
